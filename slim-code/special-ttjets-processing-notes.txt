  1) Make the slimmed skims for the TTJets files if you haven't already

      .L run_slimskim.c+
      run_slimskim("/data/strange2/--------/tree_LDP","tree_TTJets*.root")
      run_slimskim("/data/strange2/--------/tree_signal","tree_TTJets*.root")
    

  2) Run the code that selects only the events that are acceptable in the combination
     Make sure you set the input directory argument to yours.

      .L run_ttbar_filter_skims.c+  (uses do_ttbar_filter_skim.c)
      run_ttbar_filter_skims()

  3) Check the output by running ttbar_comp.c
     Make sure you set the input directory argument to yours.

      .L ttbar_comp.c+
      ttbar_comp("your-input-directory")

     The h_stitch and h_combo histograms should be identical.
     The h_stitch histogram should be a much higher stats version of the
     distribution in h_incl, but they should be consistent with each other.
